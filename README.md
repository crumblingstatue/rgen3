# rgen3

rgen3 is a suite of libraries and utilities to manipulate Generation 3 (Gen3) Pokémon games.

Gen3 games include Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen and Emerald/Ruby/Sapphire.

Below are the currently existing tools.

## rgen3-save

A library to manipulate save files. It also includes an example tool that generates a random
pokémon team for you!

## rgen3-string

A library to encode/decode the proprietary string format used for Gen3. 

# Why not use an existing tool?
I couldn't find an already existing save file manipulation tool that works well on Linux.
